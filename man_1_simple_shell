.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a custom UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a command line interpreter that provides a traditional user interface for UNIX-like systems. It reads commands from standard input or a terminal and executes them.

.PP
The shell follows these basic steps:
.IP 1. 2
Display a prompt and wait for user input.
.IP 2. 2
Parse the input into a command and its arguments.
.IP 3. 3
Check if the command is a built-in.
.IP 4. 4
If not a built-in, search for the command in the directories listed in the PATH.
.IP 5. 5
Execute the command in a child process using fork and execve.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following commands are handled internally by the shell:

.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell.

.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables to standard output.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
.B simple_shell
uses the 
.B PATH
environment variable to locate commands. If a command name contains a slash (/), the shell will attempt to execute that specific file. Otherwise, it searches each directory in the PATH.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the shell returns 0. If a command is not found, an error message is printed to standard error.

.SH ERROR HANDLING
If an executable cannot be found, the shell prints an error message in the following format:
.PP
.B ./hsh: [line_number]: [command]: not found

.SH BUGS
This shell does not currently support pipes, redirections, semicolons, or advanced logical operators (&&, ||).
